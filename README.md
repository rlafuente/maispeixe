Description
-----------

MaisPeixe is a small script which allows one to download mp3 files from a
user's MySpace page.

The reason for making this was that MySpace's awful Flash interface for audio
kept crashing my browser. And that's more than enough for a personal itch ;)

It goes without saying that all responsibility that running this script entails
is yours only. 

Usage
-----

First, to find the appropriate username to grok, google your desired artist,
followed by 'myspace' (e.g. 'Joakim myspace'); you're looking for the MySpace
page URL, which should be the first result most of the time (e.g.
'www.myspace.com/jimibazzouka'). Note down the username and run MaisPeixe, which
in Joakim's case would be:

    maispeixe jimibazzouka

And if now you wish to get his songs, you would do

    maispeixe jimibazzouka -a
    (this requires the wget package.)

That's all there is to it. For additional options when running MaisPeixe, try

    maispeixe -h
